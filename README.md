Basic website using ASP.NET Framework, bootstrap, Entity Framework and a few other things.
Made the mistake of using most of my time planning the end product, instead of setting a 
Minimum Viable Product point and then working from there. Had issue with Azure deployment
that still puzzles me. Most likely have to delete Azure database and restart. Styling was
started, not finished so I could focus on next project.
